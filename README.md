This project programmed with android studio by Kotlin language
And it is for the card player to calculate the scores for every stage
By sorting the scores from high to low; showing the player with minmum score to be the first one and coloring it by the green
And the maximum player score to be the last one and coloring it by the red
The "red player" will take the cards and to contibute them to another players making it "the weaker player"
